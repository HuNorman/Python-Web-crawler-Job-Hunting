# Python-Web-crawler-Job-Hunting
*Fight for your dream and your life.  Never give up! Mark!*  
*It is a little pity for a senior year student whose major is translation and interpretation to fall in love with Python-programming.
Since it is critical time for every one with me to hunt for a job.  
And i just have a new idea to hunt for a technical job.  
Great pressure from inside and outside keep crashing on me.   
Family hope that i could well prepare for the examination of civil servant.
But that is not what i want.
I have once imagined that what if i find a job related with my major and i continue to learn.
However, the will in my heart is so still that i will not change.
My major and my previous experience will become the barrier to hunt for a development job.
Thus, the github could turn into a secret corner for me to save code and reminds me that I am not supposed to give up.*
